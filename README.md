# Multi-View-Camera-Calibration-Dataset
The purpose of the multi-view camera calibration dataset is to train a deep network to estimate vanishing points and external camera parameters. In this dataset, each image has a unique camera rotation angle, and the label file stores the name, vanishing point, and camera pose of each image.
