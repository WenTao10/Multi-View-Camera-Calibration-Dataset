# Multi-View-Camera-Calibration-Dataset (MVCCD)
The multi-view camera calibration dataset aims to train a deep network to estimate vanishing points and external camera parameters. In this dataset, each image has a unique camera rotation angle, and the label file stores the image name, vanishing point, and camera pose of each image. Our latest work adds a large-scale synthetic dataset of about 336,000 images and corresponding label files generated by the CARLA simulator.

- The real-world dataset contains 17 typical highway scenes and the synthetic dataset contains 36 typical highway scenes.
