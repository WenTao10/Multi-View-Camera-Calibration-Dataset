# Multi-View-Camera-Calibration-Dataset (MVCCD)
The purpose of the multi-view camera calibration dataset is to train a deep network to estimate vanishing points and external camera parameters. In this dataset, each image has a unique camera rotation angle, and the label file stores the name, vanishing point, and camera pose of each image.

- This dataset contains 17 typical expressway scenes and is divided into 9 straight road scenes and 8 curved road scenes according to the expressway appearance.
- There are 32,712 images in the dataset. The training set accounts for 67%, the validation set accounts for 17%, and the test set accounts for 16%.
- These images are available in RGB format and 1920x1080 resolution.
- The pitch angle of the camera varies in the range of [0°, 19.8°], while the yaw angle ranges from [−29.3°, 29°].
- The average camera height is about 12m.
